## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Domain:** Social Media, Digital Marketing, Data Science  
- **Objective:** Understand what drives engagement (likes, shares, comments) and build a machine learning model to predict future post performance  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Data:** Synthetic dataset capturing post-level engagement metrics (curated for demonstration purposes)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA notebook, we dig into:

✨ Engagement distribution patterns (likes, shares, comments)  
✨ Correlation studies to identify which features drive success  
✨ Visualizations (histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, interactive plots)  
✨ Temporal trends in user engagement (day of week, time of posting)  
✨ Outlier detection and cleaning strategies  
✨ In-depth feature analysis to guide modeling  

These insights help content strategists optimize posting schedules and maximize audience reach.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Predictive Analysis

The ML notebook covers:

🔹 Preprocessing and feature engineering  
🔹 Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features  
🔹 Building regression models (Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.)  
🔹 Performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)  
🔹 Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
🔹 Residual analysis and model diagnostics  

This modeling pipeline predicts engagement outcomes for unseen posts, offering a powerful tool for campaign planning.
